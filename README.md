# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Why a bingo game?

I created this project to see how well ChatGPT could build a web application. I chose Svelte because I have very little experience with it, so I wasnâ€™t able to make many changes myself. Almost everything you see here was generated by ChatGPT.

## Before starting

If you want to run this app yourself, you first need to create a .env file:

VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=  
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
